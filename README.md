# Hotel_Booking_Demands

Background

In the hotel industry, revenue management is applicable to provide the right rooms and prices to the right guests at the right time through the right distribution channels. Additionally, this industry also accepts advance reservations, and they represent a contract between the customer and the hotel. This contract gives the customer the right to use the service at a fixed price in the future. Advanced booking is considered as one of the main predictors of hotel performance forecasting. However, a customer can choose to cancel their booking before the service is being provided. This option to cancel puts the hotel at risk as it will force the hotel to bear the cost of vacant rooms.


The Problem

In the travel industry, prediction problems are most focused in the aviation sector as data is most readily available in the common format known as Passenger Name Record (PNR). However, in the remaining travel industry like the hospitality sector prediction problems have a different requirement which is incomplete without the industry-specific data. Therefore, two hotel datasets with their demand data were used to perform this prediction problem. One of the hotels is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel.


The goal of this study

The goal of this study is to predict whether a hotel booking request received is subject
to a cancellation given its booking information with key attributes.


Solution

A solution which employs various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and Decision Trees was proposed to model and predict whether a booking request is supposed to get cancelled in future. A well trained and generalized model will be able to classify cancelled bookings with a reasonable accuracy. Furthermore,  dimension reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis were also implemented to streamline the data. The models were tested for their accuracy and robustness using evaluation metrics like ROC curves and Lift Charts. The goal of this study is to successfully identify whether a booking request received in advance by a hotel is about to be cancelled in future or not.
