# Hotel_Booking_Demands

Background
In the hotel industry, revenue management is applicable to provide the right rooms and prices to the right guests at the right time through the right distribution channels.
Additionally, this industry also accepts advance reservations, and they represent a
contract between the customer and the hotel. This contract gives the customer the
right to use the service at a fixed price in the future. Advanced booking is considered
as one of the main predictors of hotel performance forecasting. However, a customer
can choose to cancel their booking before the service is being provided. This option
to cancel puts the hotel at risk as it will force the hotel to bear the cost of vacant
rooms.

The goal of this study:

The goal of this study is to predict whether a hotel booking request received is subject
to a cancellation given its booking information with key attributes.
